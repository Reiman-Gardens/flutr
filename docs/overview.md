# Flutr — Architecture Overview

## About

Flutr is a multi-tenant web application for butterfly houses to manage butterfly species, track shipments, monitor quality metrics, and provide public-facing educational experiences. Built as a Senior Design project with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a core requirement.

## Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design

Flutr uses a shared database with institution-level data isolation:

- The `[institution]` dynamic route segment scopes all pages to a specific institution
- Every data table references an `institution_id` foreign key
- Authentication tokens carry `institutionId` for server-side filtering
- The `butterfly_species` table is global (shared reference data); `butterfly_species_institution` adds per-institution customization

### Route Groups

```
/login                              # Public login page
/admin/dashboard                    # Protected — platform dashboard (SUPERUSER)
/admin/institutions                 # Protected — platform institutions (SUPERUSER)
/[institution]/(tenant)/dashboard   # Protected — institution dashboard
/[institution]/(tenant)/inventory   # Protected — butterfly inventory
/[institution]/(tenant)/shipments   # Protected — shipment list
/[institution]/(tenant)/shipments/add # Protected — add shipment
/[institution]/(public)/            # Public — institution landing page
/[institution]/(public)/stats       # Public — institution statistics
/[institution]/(public)/[butterfly] # Public — species detail page
```

- `(tenant)` routes are protected by NextAuth middleware
- `(public)` routes are accessible without authentication
- `/admin/*` platform pages are protected by server-side checks in `src/app/(platform)/admin/layout.tsx` (not middleware matcher)
- Shared app navigation paths are centralized in `src/lib/routes.ts` (`ROUTES`) to avoid hardcoded URL drift.

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits email/password to `/login`
2. NextAuth credentials provider verifies via bcrypt
3. JWT token is issued with `role` and `institutionId` claims
4. Middleware intercepts `(tenant)` routes and checks session validity
5. Platform pages under `/admin/*` enforce authz in the platform admin layout (`auth()` + `requireUser()` + `canCrossTenant()`)
6. Server components/API routes use `auth()` to access session data

### Database Layer

PostgreSQL 17 managed via Drizzle ORM:

- Schema defined in `src/lib/schema.ts`
- Client singleton in `src/lib/db.ts`
- Migrations in `drizzle/` directory
- Docker Compose for local development

### Component Architecture

- **Shadcn/UI**: 55 pre-installed primitives in `src/components/ui/`
- **Feature components**: Organized by domain (`admin/`, `auth/`, `public/`)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for statistics dashboards
- **Maps**: Leaflet powers the public geographic origin heat map
- **Theming**: next-themes for light/dark mode

## Data Model

### Core Entities

- **Institution** — A butterfly house organization (address, contact, branding)
- **User** — An account scoped to an institution with a role
- **Butterfly Species** — Global scientific reference data
- **Butterfly Species Institution** — Institution-specific species details (common name, description, image)
- **Supplier** — Butterfly vendor/supplier
- **Shipment** — A butterfly shipment record with quality/damage tracking metrics

### Key Relationships

```
Institution ─┬─ Users
              ├─ Butterfly Species Institution ── Butterfly Species (global)
              └─ Shipments ─┬─ Butterfly Species (global)
                            └─ Supplier
```

## API Routes

### Public (`/api/public/*`)

- `/api/public/institutions` — List public institutions.
- `/api/public/institutions/[slug]` — Public institution details.
- `/api/public/institutions/[slug]/gallery` — Public gallery data for an institution.
- `/api/public/institutions/[slug]/in-flight` — Current in-flight data for an institution.
- `/api/public/institutions/[slug]/species` — Species visible for an institution.
- `/api/public/institutions/[slug]/species/[scientific_name]` — Detailed species view for an institution.
- `/api/public/species` — Global species listing.

### Tenant & Platform

- `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` — NextAuth authentication.
- `/api/public/*` — Public, no-auth API surface (see `docs/api/README.md` for index).
- `/api/tenant/*` — Authenticated, tenant-scoped API surface.
- `/api/platform/*` — SUPERUSER-only API surface.
- Platform historical shipment endpoints (SUPERUSER only):
  - `GET /api/platform/institutions/[id]/shipments` — List shipment summary (id, supplier, dates, item count, total received) for an institution.
  - `DELETE /api/platform/institutions/[id]/shipments` — Bulk-delete shipments for an institution. Body: `{ mode: "all" | "year" | "range", year?, from?, to? }`. Returns `{ deleted: number }`.
  - `POST /api/platform/institutions/[id]/shipments/import/preview` — Parse + validate historical shipment input (no writes).
  - `POST /api/platform/institutions/[id]/shipments/import/commit` — Commit validated historical shipments with supplier/species resolution rules.
  - `GET /api/platform/institutions/[id]/shipments/export?format=xlsx[&from=YYYY-MM-DD][&to=YYYY-MM-DD]` — Export institution shipment history as XLSX, optionally filtered by date range.
- Tenant historical shipment endpoints (requires `x-tenant-slug` header):
  - `GET /api/tenant/shipments/summary` — List shipment summary for the tenant institution.
  - `DELETE /api/tenant/shipments` — Tenant-scoped bulk-delete shipments (institution admin only). Body: `{ mode: "all" | "year" | "range", year?, from?, to? }`. Returns `{ deleted: number }`.
  - `POST /api/tenant/shipments/import/preview` — Tenant-scoped parse + validate historical input (no writes).
  - `POST /api/tenant/shipments/import/commit` — Tenant-scoped commit using preview hash.
  - `GET /api/tenant/shipments/export?format=xlsx[&from=YYYY-MM-DD][&to=YYYY-MM-DD]` — Tenant-scoped XLSX export, optionally filtered by date range.

### Backend Architecture

Authenticated API routes follow a three-layer pattern:

```
Route → Service → Query
```

- **Routes** (`src/app/api/tenant/*`) — validation and HTTP responses only; no auth or business logic
- **Services** (`src/lib/services/`) — auth, permission checks, and tenant resolution
- **Queries** (`src/lib/queries/`) — raw database access; no auth logic

Example flow for `GET /api/tenant/users`:

```
Route  →  getTenantUsers({ slug })  →  listUsersForTenant(tenantId, user)
```

Services throw `new Error("UNAUTHORIZED")` or `new Error("FORBIDDEN")` which routes map to 401/403 responses. Tenant errors (`resolveTenantBySlug`, `tenantCondition`) propagate and are handled by `handleTenantError`.

### Tenant Scoping

- **ADMIN / EMPLOYEE**: automatically scoped to their own institution via `x-tenant-slug` header; cross-tenant access is rejected
- **SUPERUSER**: can target any institution by providing its slug via `x-tenant-slug`; `resolveTenantBySlug` enforces that non-SUPERUSERs can only access their own institution's slug

### User Tenant Enforcement

All user-level operations are tenant-scoped at the query layer.

Routes MUST NOT:

- fetch users globally
- apply tenant filtering after fetch

Instead:

- queries enforce `institution_id` via `tenantCondition`

Security guarantee:

- users outside the tenant are indistinguishable from non-existent users (404)

### Tenant Users API Contract

All tenant routes require the `x-tenant-slug` header. Missing the header returns `400 INVALID_REQUEST`.

#### `GET /api/tenant/users`

```json
{ "users": [...] }
```

#### `GET /api/tenant/users/:id`

```json
{ "user": {...} }
```

#### `POST /api/tenant/users`

```json
{ "user": {...} }
```

#### `PATCH /api/tenant/users/:id`

```json
{ "user": {...} }
```

#### `DELETE /api/tenant/users/:id`

```json
{ "deleted": true }
```

## Infrastructure

### Local Development

Docker Compose runs PostgreSQL and Drizzle Studio. The Next.js dev server runs locally for fast hot reload with Turbopack.

```bash
docker compose up -d       # Start PostgreSQL + Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:push               # Sync schema (first run)
pnpm dev                   # Start Next.js dev server
```

| Service  | Port | Description        |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| `db`     | 5432 | PostgreSQL 17      |
| `studio` | 4983 | Drizzle Studio GUI |

Each Docker service can be restarted independently with `docker compose restart <service>`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable          | Description                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`    | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth encryption secret   |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | Application base URL         |
